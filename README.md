# yt_video_downloader
- A Python gradio app that downloads YouTube videos given their URL.
- It also provides an option to download only the audio track for the given video URL.
### Setup:
- Clone the repo and move to the root dir.
- Create a python virtual environment.
- Install the requirements.
- Ignore the dependency conflict between gradio and yt-dlp
- Run main_gradio.py

### Note:
- Replaced pytube with yt-dlp (which is a fork of youtube-dl but better)
- Simply install the requirements as the versions mentioned, it'd work fine
