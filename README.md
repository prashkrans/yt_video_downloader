# Youtube Video Downloader
- A Python gradio app that downloads YouTube videos given their URL.
- It also provides an option to download only the audio track for the given video URL.

### Pre-requisites:
FFMPEG:
`sudo apt install ffmpeg`

### Setup:
- Clone the repo and move to the root dir.
- Create a python virtual environment.
- Install the requirements.
- Ignore the dependency conflict between gradio and yt-dlp
- Run main_gradio.py

### Quick setup for Windows 10/11:
- Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
- Run the `YT_Video_Downloader_Setup.bat` (only the first time) inside the docker directory by double clicking on it.
- It automatically pulls a working image (~500 MBs) from the public repo of `yt_video_downloader` from the docker hub, then creates a container from it and runs it.
- There's no need to clone the repo here as the `.bat` file and the `docker image` from the docker hub does everything here.
- Then use the docker desktop console to stop and start this container as required.
- **Troubleshoot:** Whenever there's any issue simply delete both the yt_video_downloader container and image in the docker desktop console and re-run the `YT_Video_Downloader_Setup.bat` (only once).

### Note:
- Replaced pytube with yt-dlp (which is a fork of youtube-dl but better)
- Simply install the requirements as the versions mentioned, it'd work fine
